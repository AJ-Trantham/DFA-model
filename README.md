# DFA-model
This program simulates a Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA). It takes input text files formatted accordingly 
and outputs the language and which strings in the input file are accepted in the DFA's language. 

To run the program run the following commands from the DFA-model directory: 
 
_[you@onyx]$ javac fa/dfa/DFADriver.java_

_[you@onyx]$ java fa.dfa.DFADriver ./[test-file-path]

## Overview

This program simulates a Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA). It takes input text files formatted accordingly 
and outputs the language and which strings in the input file are accepted in the DFA's language.

## Compiling and Using

To compile the program, run the following command from the DFA-model directory: 
 
_[you@onyx]$ javac fa/dfa/DFADriver.java_

To run the program, run the following command from the DFA-model directory: 

_[you@onyx]$ java fa.dfa.DFADriver ./[test-file-path]


## Discussion

Discuss the issues and successes you encountered during programming
(development). Here are some questions to get you started. You don't
have to answer all of them in order - they are a guideline to get you
thinking.

Figuring out which Set to use, and how to use it was a challenge. Our initial planning made it very simple to use a 
non-set data structure, and changing it was surprisingly difficult. 

Another challenge was figuring out IDEs. We used IntelliJ (a relitively simple IDE) as it is easy to use with git. 
Surprisingly, we had a lot of trouble with file paths because of it. Ultimately, we had to use the command line for 
everything. 
 
The project itself was fairly simple and fun. Neither of us are coding very much this semester, so it was a nice 
change of pace. 

## Testing

We succesfully pass the provided test cases on the Onyx server.
